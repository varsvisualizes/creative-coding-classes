# Hello World

Hi, I'm Carmen and I like to code. I like it enough that I like helping everyone who's got even the faintest inclination towards learning to code, as best as I can.

This repository is going to host the code I've written for events where I've taught coding. You'll have generative art ideas, text & typography play, physical computing, and web design. Even if you're coming from absolute baseline - you haven't even written your first "Hello World" code - you can use the resources here to build up your skills. I want you to learn something cool and run with it. 

### Mission

My goal is to provide resources and information that is always free to use. Learning is a right, and especially if you're learning through the library system, every resources made available to you shouldn't be paywalled. I will aim to list costs or stipulations should they be relevant, but overwhelmingly, I want to focus on providing free content for all.

# Circuit Playground
In 2022, I borrowed 4 Circuit Playground Bluefruits through SEFLIN. I ran a couple of physical computing programs during the summer, teaching the kids how to use CircuitPython. I think I also ran one session teaching Arduino.

I've also used the Circuit Playground for outreach - see more at [the Prizewheel repo](https://github.com/varsvisualizes/circuitplayground-prizewheel).

For libraries looking to access the Circuit Playgrounds, please get in touch with SEFLIN regarding their use. Let them know that the last time they were used was at the Acreage Branch Library.

If you want to purchase one for your own hobby practice, you can find them through Adafruit! I personally have used the Classic and Bluefruit, but not the Express--though seemingly, the majority of tutorials are tailored to the Express, so do what you will there.

# Creative Coding Club
Since 2023 I've hosted programs for kids and teenagers teaching them how to use p5.js. I decided to use p5.js because I wanted to give kids a chance at coding beyond a block editor like Scratch or MakeCode - let them really get their hands wet! Plus, p5.js is intentionally designed for creatives who are perhaps beginners at programming, so the code is more intuitive to follow for early coders.

## List of Programs
* September 2023: Generative Art
* December 2023: Fractals
* January 2024: Computer Vision
* April 2024: Poetry Generator

# Web Design 101
In March 2024 I hosted my first in-person coding class for adults. The aim was to create a 1-paged website, drawing inspiration from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. You can see [my sample webpage here](https://varsvisualizes.github.io/mr-whiskers/).

Full disclosure: I majorly overshot what could be accomplished in an hour. Our webpages really turned out something like this: (picture to come, lol)

Initially, I felt disappointed that I couldn't help my class achieve the full vision I'd had in mind. However, for the attendees, it was - for the most part - their true first time coding anything, ever. That alone makes the outcome wildly special. They've jumped the hurdle of not knowing anything: now they know they can learn to code, because they've got the proof. My hope is that they will continue to grow and make even cooler things in the future.

# Resources

## Circuit Playground

NOTE: As of late 2023, something's been up with CircuitPython burning onto the Circuit Playgrounds. The bootloader itself is messed up - the forums were all in a fuss about it, and I couldn't get any of the CircuitPlaygrounds running using Circuit Python. It drove me bananas for a solid 8 hours. Hopefully by the time you get your hands on a Circuit Playground, should you decide to try CircuitPython, the issue will be resolved. If not, good old Arduino is there for you.
